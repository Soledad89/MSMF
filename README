	M-Simple Makefile Framework is easy makefile for developer who build product 
with fixed compiler and system. This framework didn't consider any problem about 
migrating code from different platform, you need fix your tool-chain. This tool
only valid for GNU tool-chain and run under bash shell.

	There is 3 makefiles in this framework, the rule.mk is core makefile which 
contain the real rules for make. The common.mk is global configure for the whole
project. Makefile include these 2 files and it's the "worker" makefile.
